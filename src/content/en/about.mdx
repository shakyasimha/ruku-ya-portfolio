My interest and work involves Language, Linguistics, Newa issues, Nepala Bhasa, Law, and SOGIESC issues. I engage in knowledge production through research, awareness toolkit publications, academic writing, and so on. I also engage in policy and legal issues, in which I mostly center on litigation.


Since N.S. 1141 (2020), my work has become more focused on SOGIESC issues, through registration of Queer Youth Group (QYG) as a not-for-profit, which was a loose network I co-initiated. As a part of QYG, my work has mostly entailed engaging in production of resource materials on SOGIESC. Similarly, I have focused on legal activism through litigation, which entails filing writ petitions at Supreme Court & High Courts on issues of concern to the PoMSOGIESC demography, providing legal assistance to PoMSOGIESC individuals on issues pertaining to their rights, which has predominantly been about, but not limited to, legal gender recognition issues of transgender folks.


Since N.S. 1143 (2022), I began working around Jugi community’s traditional abode of Satachhen. I have been lobbying, campaigning and petitioning to ensure right of ownership, right to housing and several other aspects of the community’s historical residence.


I am a trans woman. My pronouns are she/her. I go by the title Ms. I describe my sexual orientation as panromantic and fluid.


My date of birth is N.S. 1119 Chila 16 (4 March 1999 C.E.) In Newa culture, we observe our rituals based on Lunar Calendar of the Nepala Sambata, therefore I celebrate my birthday on the month of Chila (fifth month), third lunar phase of the dark fortnight.


My nationality is Nepa-mi (Nepali). I come from the Newa inidgenous nationality. Within Newa, I am from the Jugi community.


I have a mild physical disability, i.e. residual disability from treated bilateral congenital clubfeet.
